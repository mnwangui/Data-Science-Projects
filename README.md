# INTRODUCTION

## PRELIMINARY DESCRIPTION OF THE 311 DATA
This data is the New York City’s primary source of government information and non-emergency services. NYC311 data originated from reports by New Yorkers to the authorities of a strange smell that was feared that it might cause chemical warfare especially from Aunt Jemima wing of al Qaeda. 

The data was enhanced more on January 29, 2009, when another maple syrup event commenced in northern Manhattan. Launched in March 2003, 311 now fields on average more than 50,000 calls a day, offering information about more than 3,600 topics: school closings, recycling rules, homeless shelters, park events, pothole repairs. 

This data formed a giant arrow aiming at a group of industrial plants in north eastern New Jersey. The service has translators on call to handle some 180 different languages. NYC Open Data makes the public data generated by various New York City Agencies and other City organizations available for public use. The data sets are available in a variety of machine-readable formats and are refreshed when new data becomes available. Data is presented by category, by City Agency, or by other City organization.

NYC311 works continuously to make government services more accessible to non-English speakers, with 180 languages available in the call center and more than 50 languages available online. The 311service request dataset is available from 2010 to present, is updated daily, and contains over 9 million rows of data.


#The Data Set

• NYC311 is a very massive dataset with approximately 9,124,937 observations and approximately 52 variables.

• Due to the presence of so many duplicated observations, about 1,670,064 observations are dropped and 37 redundant and missing value columns also dropped. NYC311 dataset is left with about 7,454,873 observations and 15 columns for this specific analysis.

• By mutating the datetime using the lubridate function, I am able to get 5 new variables namely: year, month, wday, timetaken (difference between Created date and Closed date) and resolvetime (difference between due date and resolution action updated date)

• For this specific assignment, I filtered the data with Agency as the key which allowed me to only deal with Complaints that involved the Biggest Agency. 

• The Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD) emerged as the biggest agency. Heating Complaint was visualized as the most complaint that 311 was used on concerning HPD Agency. 

• 30% of complaints are being resolved within 24 hours while the rest takes from 1 to 20 or more days.

• Complaints from unspecified Boroughs take longer time to be solved.

# SECOND DATASET: DOL Annual Population Estimates for New York State and Boroughs

Each year, the Census Bureau's Population Estimates Program (PEP) utilizes current data on births,
deaths, and migration to calculate population change and produce a time series of estimates of population, demographic components of change, and housing units. The annual time series of estimates
begins with the most recent decennial census data and extends to the vintage year.

Each vintage of estimates includes all years since the most recent decennial census, and the latest
vintage of data available supersedes all previously-produced estimates for those dates.

The data includes intercensal estimates for 1970-2009 and postcensal estimates for 2010 and later for New York State and all New York State Counties, and the decennial Census counts for 1970-2010.

Intercensal estimates are population estimates produced for the years between two decennial censuses when both the beginning and ending populations are known. They are produced once a decade by adjusting the existing time series of postcensal estimates for the entire decade to smooth the transition from one decennial census count to the next. 

They differ from the postcensal estimates that are released annually because they rely on a mathematical formula that redistributes the difference between the April 1 postcensal estimate and April 1 census count for the end of the decade across the estimates for that decade. 

For dates when both postcensal and intercensal estimates are available, intercensal estimates are preferred. 

# JOINING THE TWO DATASETS: NYC311 AND NYCPopulation DATA

This is aimed at establishing the relationship between the population of New York City and the complaints that are made through 311. This data of population is joined together with the 311 one to find out the following:

What is the rate of complaining per population?

What is the demographic distribution in New York City within the Boroughs?

Is there any relationship between population growth over the years to complaints growth over the years?

# MOTIVATION

I am therefore motivated by the above to establish how effective 311 has been in New York city and how easy it is to know which Borough to live in case one decides to relocate to New York. I am excited to juggle around this massive dataset with my limited knowledge in visualization and help me in my discovery journey.

```


## Observations:

* Weekends are the less busiest days of the week with Sunday being the least

* New York residents make more calls on Monday through Friday respectively

* The beginning of the week see 311 very busy and eases up as weekend draws near.



# What was the most complaint that HPD received through 311?

```


##Findings:

Heating was the most complaint that New Yorkers called 311 to complain about. 
The Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD) received approximately 659,046 Complaints from New York residents on HEATING.


# Example of nyc311 dataset

```{r tabulate, results="asis",echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}

```


```{r chunk b,fig.height=8,fig.width=12,echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
df <- BigAgency %>%
select(Complaint.Type,Borough,Created.Date,Closed.Date,Due.Date,Resolution.Action.Updated.Date,timetaken,resolvetime,Status,Location,

xlab("Category") +
geom_bar(stat="identity") +
      ggtitle("Top Complaints by Type and Borough")
```


The analysis above indicates that Brooklyn Borough kept calling 311 frequently and complained more on Heating. 
Staten Island Borough on the other hand had the lowest amount of Complaints. 


# What is the relationship between the complaints and the number of years? Have the complaints increased, decreased or stagnated?

```{r chunk 3, fig.height=8,fig.width=12, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
ggplot(BigAgency, aes(x=year, y=Complaint.Type, color=Borough)) + 
    geom_point(size=8)
```


## Observations:

* The above analysis indicates that as years have progressed, complaints to 311 have increased. 

* Most of the unspecified Boroughs were from complaints between 2010 and 2011 when the platform was still being developed.

* Between 2012 and 2015, there are no observations from unspecified Boroughs.

* Complaints have increased as years have progressed with 2014 registering the highest number of complaints.


# How long does it take for HPD Agency to close a complaint once it is created?

```{r,chunk 4,fig.height=8,fig.width=12, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
ggplot(BigAgency, aes(x = Closed.Date, y = Complaint.Type)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = Borough, size = 3))
```


## Observations

* HPD Agency takes less time to close a complaint across the Boroughs. 

* Unspecified Boroughs take longer than the rest of the Boroughs for their complaints to be sorted. This may be associated to their lack of direction most probably.

* Only a few complaints take long to be sorted out by HPD Agency.

* Filtering the unspecified Boroughs, Queens Borough topped in Unsanitary conditions, Paint-Plaster, heat or hot water and on electric complaints conditions. 

* Bronx was the lowest Borough in all the complaints

* Waterleak, unsanitary condition, paint-plaster, general, door or window, flooring or stairs were the least to be complained about. 

* Manhattan Borough topped in the complaints of water leak, door or window and appliances.

## Observations

* January is the month that receives the highest calls of complainants. 

* This can be attributed to the largest complaint to HPD Agency of heating. 

* May to September are the months that give HPD Agency some rest since the complaints fluctuate and stabilize.

# Observation

* Plumbing, Heating and General Construction were the highest complaints that New York Population complained about.

* Manhattan people complained mostly on Appliance, Door or Window, Unsanitary condition, Water Leak, Paint and Plaster among others.

* Queens people were more concerned with unsanitary condition, non-construction, paint-plaster, plumbing, general construction, heat or hot water among others. 

* Brooklyn and Bronx population complained more on water leak, flooring and stairs, appliances, door or window.


# Population and complaints growth over time:

  geom_line(aes(y = Population), color = "darkred") + 
  geom_line(aes(y = Complaints), color="steelblue", linetype="twodash")
```


## Observation

* The darkred line represent population and the steelblue line one represent complaints. 

* The analysis shows a positive relationship between population and complaints; the higher the population increases, the higher the number of complaints. 


# The trend of complaints in HPD Agency in terms of Population and Complaints and their types.

```


## Observation

* Plumbing has been a problem since 2002.

* Flooring and stairs complaints became an issue when population increased more.


# Conclusion

This document has been created by importing data from nyc311 dataset to R software. The data has gone through the stage of tydying and transformation in order to help in Visualization, Modelling and Communication. 

This being a massive data, visualization and modelling has been limited to some observations to allow the me deduce a few things from the sample. 

nyc311 dataset is very informative and several things have been realized from the sample data that has been visualized:

* Brooklyn had the highest incidences of complaints compared to other Boroughs and Brooklyn had more complaint types described by both floor and pests than other Boroughs. 

* HPD Agency is the biggest in terms of complaints made through 311

* Heat related complaints- Heat related complaints are the most common complaints of New Yorkers across boroughs. 

* The number of complaints received by HPD are enormous compared to other boroughs and consequently HPD takes longer resolution time.

* May be HPD can consider employing more personnel to assist especially in the months that heating complaints become too much.

* Weekends complaints for HPD are lower compared to other complaints like noise. 

* Brooklyn has the highest volume of complaints.

* January is the month that receives the highest calls of complainants especially on heating. 

* This can be attributed to the largest complaint to HPD Agency of heating. 

* May to September are the months that give HPD Agency some rest since the complaints fluctuate and stabilize.

* October to December see HPD Agency running again to solve issues which keep increasing. 

* HPD Agency has been resolving complaints from 311 callers of between 300 to 3000 in a day over the years.

* The year 2013 saw actions taken over complaints rising to 5000 in a day.

* Brooklyn has the highest population and as established; population is positively related to complaints, thus, there are more complaints from Brooklyn compared to other Boroughs. However, Queens being second largest population wise; it lead in:

* Unsanitary conditions

* Paint-Plaster

* Heat or hot water

* Electric complaints conditions. 

* Staten Island has the lowest population and her complaints too to HPD Agency were not as many as for the rest of Boroughs. 

* The following were least complained about:

* Water leak

* Unsanitary condition

* Paint-plaster

* General

* Door or window

* Flooring or stairs 

* Manhattan Borough topped in the complaints of water leak, door or window and appliances.

## From this exercise, we can provide the below recommendations:

* To have a predefined full mapping for each complaint type. This shall ensure that all cells are filled up therefore reducing the cases of missing values.

* The Due Date and Resolution Action Updated Date have a lot of missing values. There should be automation to that effect where every complaint is updated once a solution has been provided. 

* There are too many columns for school with no information. This should be improved. 

* Cases should be clustered according to their similarities to avoid duplication of information.
